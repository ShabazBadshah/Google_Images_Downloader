# Google Images Downloader

A Python program that downloads images from google images based on a query given and saves them into seperate folders, limited to downloading 100 images per query.

## Why

I made this since Google deprecated their Google Images API and I didn't want to manually save all images

## Prerequisites:
- BeautifulSoup library installed in Python environment
- URLlib librarie installed in Python environment


## Current limitations:
- Only searches the first page of Google Images (need to add in scrolling support)
- Right now, you have to run the Python program, I may convert this to a shell script at some point in the future
