# Google Images Downloader
A python program that downloads images from google images based on a query given and saves them into seperate folders, limited to downloading 100 images per query.

BeautifulSoup and URLlib libraries required.

I made this since Google deprecated their Google Images API

Current limitations:
- Only searches the first page of Google Images (need to add in scrolling support)
- Right now, you have to run the Python program, I may convert this to a shell script at some point in the future
